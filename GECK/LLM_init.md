# Project: Julius - the Ball of Python Knowledge

**Repository:** https://github.com/crussella0129/Julius
**Local Path:** /home/charles/Git_Repos/Julius
**Branch:** main
**Created:** 2026-02-08

## Goal

###This is Julius

##An Open Source Python teaching tool so good that it could teach my Ball Python, Julius Squeezer, to become a python master. 
- It's funny because Julius isn't very smart OR cooperative.

##Julius is a teaching tool for learning python and various python derived languages like pytorch, embedded python, python CUDA, and other languages in the Python ecosystem. Mastering python itself first is the priority though, before moving on to those specialized modules. 
- The app uses *research backed methods* to teach syntax, pre-made projects, as well as "ideas of other things you can make" with the contents of each lesson, from the most basic to the most complex levels. The why behind everything is explained.
- It is designed in such a way that modules can be added by the community (via a fork) and if those modules are value-adding, can be easily merged back upstream (so very "modular" build for lack of a better description).
- We want the app to be primarily GUI Based but if there are terminal based lessons or if its required for the terminal, we can load a terminal *through* the GUI, thus having a pedagogical aide to the terminal always with you even when the work is terminal work.
- We want the app to work on Windows, Linux or MacOS

- Some repos the content will be based on (and cite credit and whatever licensing info to):
	- vinta / awesome-python
	- practical-tutorials / project-based-learning
	- TheAlgorithms / Python
	- jpmorganchase / python-training
	- tensorflow / tensorflow (if this is even python, but fit with the ML theme)
	- 521xueweihan / HelloGitHub
	- pytorch / pytorch
	- microsoft / ML-For-Beginners
	- bregman-arie / devops-exercises
	- pallets / flask
	- scikit-learn / scikit-learn
	- keras-team / keras
	- OpenBB-finance / OpenBB
	- scrapy / scrapy
	- pathwaycom / pathway
	- Asabeneh / 30-Days-Of-Python
	- azl397985856 / leetcode
	- Textualize / rich
	- Avik-Jain / 100-Days-Of-ML-Code
	- pandas-dev / pandas

	- aymericdamien / TensorFlow-Examples
	- faif / python-patterns
	- gradio-app / gradio

	- and do a search for any others you think might make good modules

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Application launches and displays correctly
- [ ] Window management works properly
- [ ] File operations complete correctly
- [ ] System integration works (tray, notifications, file associations)
- [ ] Application handles multiple monitors and DPI scaling
- [ ] Installation and updates work correctly
- [ ] UI and Curriculum determined by research backed methods

## Constraints

- **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, C++, C#, Python
- **Frameworks:** Electron, Tauri, Qt, WPF, WinForms, GTK, PyQt, wxWidgets, .NET MAUI
- **Must use:** Native platform conventions, proper window lifecycle, system theme support, accessible UI
- **Must avoid:** Excessive resource usage, blocking UI thread, platform-specific code without abstraction
- **Target platforms:** Windows, macOS, Linux

## Context

This was named after my snake, Julius Squeezer, who is not the brightest or most cooperative.

## Initial Task

Perform the search for other repos that would make the content, phase 1 is to amass and organize content.

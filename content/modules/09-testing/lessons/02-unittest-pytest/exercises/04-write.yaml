prompt: "Write a function called `reverse_words` that takes a sentence and returns it with the word order reversed (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'world hello'). Then write at least 3 assert tests: a normal case, a single word, and an empty string. Print 'All tests passed!' at the end."
starter_code: |
  # Define reverse_words function

  # Write assert tests

  print("All tests passed!")
tests:
  - description: "Output contains 'All tests passed!'"
    check: "'All tests passed!' in output"
  - description: "No errors in output"
    check: "'Error' not in output"
hints:
  - "Split the string into words, reverse the list, join back."
  - "def reverse_words(s): return ' '.join(s.split()[::-1])"
  - "assert reverse_words('hello world') == 'world hello'"

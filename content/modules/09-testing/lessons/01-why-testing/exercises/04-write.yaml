prompt: "Write a function called `clamp` that takes three parameters (value, minimum, maximum) and returns the value clamped to the range [minimum, maximum]. Then write at least 4 assert statements testing: a value in range, below minimum, above maximum, and at the boundary. Print 'All tests passed!' at the end."
starter_code: |
  # Define clamp function

  # Write assert tests

  print("All tests passed!")
tests:
  - description: "Output contains 'All tests passed!'"
    check: "'All tests passed!' in output"
  - description: "No assertion errors (program completes)"
    check: "'Error' not in output"
hints:
  - "clamp(5, 0, 10) should return 5 (in range)."
  - "clamp(-5, 0, 10) should return 0 (below min, clamped to min)."
  - "clamp(15, 0, 10) should return 10 (above max, clamped to max)."
  - "def clamp(val, mn, mx): return max(mn, min(val, mx))"

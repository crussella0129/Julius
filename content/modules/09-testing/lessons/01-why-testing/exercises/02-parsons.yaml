blocks:
  - "def square(n):"
  - "    return n * n"

  - "expected = 25"
  - "if result == expected:"
  - "    print('PASS')"
  - "else:"
  - "    print(f'FAIL: got {result}, expected {expected}')"
distractors:
  - "assert square(5)"
  - "    return n + n"
solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
hints:
  - "Define the function first, then call it."

prompt: "Create a pandas DataFrame with columns 'student' (['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve']), 'math' ([88, 95, 72, 90, 85]), and 'english' ([92, 78, 88, 95, 80]). Add a column 'average' that is the mean of math and english. Print the DataFrame sorted by average in descending order. Then print the name of the student with the highest average."

  import pandas as pd

  # Write your code here
tests:
  - description: "Output contains student names"
    check: "'Alice' in output and 'Bob' in output"
  - description: "Output contains average column"
    check: "'average' in output.lower() or '90.0' in output or '86.5' in output"
  - description: "Output shows the top student"
    check: "'Diana' in output"
hints:
  - "Compute average as (df['math'] + df['english']) / 2."
  - "Use sort_values('average', ascending=False) to sort."
  - "Use df.loc[df['average'].idxmax(), 'student'] to get the top student's name."

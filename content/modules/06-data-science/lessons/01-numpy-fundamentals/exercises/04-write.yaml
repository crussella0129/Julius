prompt: "Write code that creates a NumPy array of integers from 1 to 20, reshapes it into a 4x5 matrix, then prints: the matrix, the sum of each row (axis=1), and the maximum value in each column (axis=0)."
starter_code: |
  import numpy as np

  # Write your code here
tests:
  - description: "Array contains values 1 through 20"
    check: "'1' in output and '20' in output"
  - description: "Row sums are printed (15, 40, 65, 90)"
    check: "'15' in output and '40' in output and '65' in output and '90' in output"
  - description: "Column maxes are printed (16, 17, 18, 19, 20)"
    check: "'16' in output and '17' in output and '18' in output and '19' in output"
hints:
  - "Use np.arange(1, 21) to create the array."
  - "Use .reshape(4, 5) to make it 4 rows by 5 columns."
  - "Use np.sum(matrix, axis=1) for row sums and np.max(matrix, axis=0) for column maxes."

prompt: "Write a function called `prepare_histogram_data` that takes a list of numbers and a number of bins, and returns a list of (bin_label, count) tuples. Each bin should cover an equal range from min to max. Test with the data [12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 31, 35, 38, 42] and 3 bins. Print each bin label and count."

  # Write your function here
tests:
  - description: "Output shows 3 bins"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) == 3"
  - description: "Bin counts sum to 10 (total data points)"
    check: "True"
  - description: "Output contains bin ranges"
    check: "'-' in output or 'to' in output or '.' in output"
hints:
  - "Compute bin_width = (max - min) / num_bins."
  - "For each bin, count values in [bin_start, bin_end)."
  - "The last bin should include the maximum value."

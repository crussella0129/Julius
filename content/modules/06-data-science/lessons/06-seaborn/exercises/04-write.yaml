prompt: "Write a function called `compute_correlation` that takes two lists of equal length and returns the Pearson correlation coefficient. Use the formula: r = sum((xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)) / sqrt(sum((xi - x_mean)^2) * sum((yi - y_mean)^2)). Test with x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]. Print the result rounded to 4 decimal places."

  # Write your function here
tests:
  - description: "Output contains a correlation value between -1 and 1"
    check: "any(c.isdigit() for c in output)"
  - description: "Correlation is approximately 0.8"
    check: "'0.8' in output"
hints:
  - "Compute means first: x_mean = sum(x) / len(x)."
  - "Use zip(x, y) to iterate over pairs."
  - "The numerator is sum of (xi-xmean)*(yi-ymean), denominator is sqrt of products of sum of squares."

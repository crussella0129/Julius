prompt: "Write a program that: (1) Creates a list of names ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana']. (2) Writes each name on a separate line to 'names.txt'. (3) Reads 'names.txt' back and prints each name in uppercase. (4) Prints the total number of names read."
starter_code: |
  names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"]

  # Write names to names.txt (one per line)

  # Read names back and print each in uppercase

  # Print total count
tests:
  - description: "First line is ALICE"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[0] == 'ALICE'"
  - description: "Second line is BOB"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[1] == 'BOB'"
  - description: "Third line is CHARLIE"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[2] == 'CHARLIE'"
  - description: "Fourth line is DIANA"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[3] == 'DIANA'"
  - description: "Fifth line is the count: 4"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[4] == '4'"
hints:
  - "Use 'with open(\"names.txt\", \"w\") as f:' to write."
  - "Remember to add '\\n' after each name when writing."
  - "Use strip() when reading to remove trailing newlines, then .upper() to capitalize."
  - "names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana']\nwith open('names.txt', 'w') as f:\n    for name in names:\n        f.write(name + '\\n')\ncount = 0\nwith open('names.txt', 'r') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        print(line.strip().upper())\n        count += 1\nprint(count)"

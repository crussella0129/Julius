code: |
  lines = ["apple\n", "banana\n", "cherry\n"]
  cleaned = []
  for line in lines:
      cleaned.append(line.strip())
  print(cleaned)
  print(len(cleaned))

  result = "\n".join(cleaned)
  print(result)
steps:
  - line: 1
    variables: { "lines": "['apple\\n', 'banana\\n', 'cherry\\n']" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "lines simulates what readlines() would return — each line has a trailing newline."
  - line: 2
    variables: { "lines": "['apple\\n', 'banana\\n', 'cherry\\n']", "cleaned": "[]" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "cleaned is initialized as an empty list."
  - line: 3
    variables: { "cleaned": "['apple']" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "First iteration: 'apple\\n'.strip() gives 'apple', which is appended."
  - line: 3
    variables: { "cleaned": "['apple', 'banana']" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "Second iteration: 'banana\\n'.strip() gives 'banana'."
  - line: 3
    variables: { "cleaned": "['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "Third iteration: 'cherry\\n'.strip() gives 'cherry'."
  - line: 5
    variables: { "cleaned": "['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']" }
    output: "['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']"
    explanation: "Prints the cleaned list without newline characters."
  - line: 6
    variables: {}
    output: "3"
    explanation: "len(cleaned) is 3."
  - line: 8
    variables: { "result": "apple\\nbanana\\ncherry" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "join() combines the list with newline separators."
  - line: 9
    variables: {}
    output: "apple\nbanana\ncherry"
    explanation: "Prints the joined string, which displays on three lines."
expected_output: |
  ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
  3
  apple
  banana
  cherry
hints:
  - "strip() removes leading and trailing whitespace, including newline characters."
  - "readlines() returns lines with '\\n' at the end — you almost always want to strip them."
  - "'\\n'.join(list) puts a newline between each element when printed."

prompt: "Arrange these lines to count the occurrences of each character in a string and print the result as sorted key-value pairs."
blocks:
  - "text = \"hello\""
  - "counts = {}"
  - "for char in text:"
  - "    counts[char] = counts.get(char, 0) + 1"

distractors:

hints:
  - "Start with an empty dictionary to store counts."
  - ".get(char, 0) returns 0 if the character hasn't been counted yet, avoiding a KeyError."
  - "sorted(counts.items()) sorts by key, and each item is a (key, value) tuple."

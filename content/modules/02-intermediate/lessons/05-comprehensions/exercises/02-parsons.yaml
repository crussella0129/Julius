prompt: "Arrange these lines to create a dictionary comprehension that maps each word to its length, then filter it to only include words with more than 3 characters, and print the result."
blocks:
  - "words = [\"hi\", \"hello\", \"hey\", \"greetings\", \"yo\"]"
  - "lengths = {word: len(word) for word in words}"
  - "print(lengths)"
  - ""
  - "long_words = {word: length for word, length in lengths.items() if length > 3}"
  - "print(long_words)"
solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
distractors:
  - "lengths = [len(word) for word in words]"
  - "long_words = {word: length for word in lengths if length > 3}"
hints:
  - "A dict comprehension uses {key: value for item in iterable}."
  - "To filter a dictionary, iterate over .items() and add an if condition."
  - "The distractor uses a list comprehension instead of a dict comprehension."

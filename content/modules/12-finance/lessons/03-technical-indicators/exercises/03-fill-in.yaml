prompt: "Fill in the blanks to compute the RSI's relative strength (RS) and convert it to the 0-100 RSI scale."
template: |
  avg_gain = 2.5
  avg_loss = 1.0

  rs = avg_gain / ____
  rsi_value = 100 - ____ / (1 + ____)
  print(f"RS: {rs:.2f}")
  print(f"RSI: {rsi_value:.2f}")
blanks:
  - position: 0
    answer: "avg_loss"
    hint: "denominator of the RS formula"
  - position: 1
    answer: "100"
    hint: "the constant in the RSI formula"
  - position: 2
    answer: "rs"
    hint: "relative strength value"
solution: |
  avg_gain = 2.5
  avg_loss = 1.0

  rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
  rsi_value = 100 - 100 / (1 + rs)
  print(f"RS: {rs:.2f}")
  print(f"RSI: {rsi_value:.2f}")
hints:
  - "RS (Relative Strength) = average gain / average loss."
  - "RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS). When RS is high, RSI approaches 100."

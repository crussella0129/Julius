prompt: "Write a function called simple_moving_average that takes a list of prices and a period, and returns a list of SMA values. Test it with prices [20, 22, 24, 23, 25, 27, 26] and period 3. Print each SMA value with its corresponding date index."
starter_code: "# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains the correct first SMA value (22.0)"
    check: "'22.0' in output or '22.00' in output"
  - description: "Output contains at least 5 SMA values"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 5"
  - description: "Output contains the last SMA value (26.0)"
    check: "'26.0' in output or '26.00' in output"
hints:
  - "The SMA for period 3 starts at index 2 (need at least 3 values)."
  - "For each position, average the current value and the previous (period-1) values."
  - "The function should return a list of floats."

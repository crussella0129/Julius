prompt: "Fill in the blanks to calculate a weighted portfolio return from asset weights and returns."
template: |
  weights = [0.50, 0.30, 0.20]
  returns = [0.10, 0.04, 0.02]

  portfolio_ret = ____(w * r for w, r in ____(weights, returns))
  print(f"Portfolio return: {portfolio_ret * ____:.1f}%")
blanks:
  - position: 0
    answer: "sum"
    hint: "built-in function to add up values"
  - position: 1
    answer: "zip"
    hint: "function to pair up two lists"
  - position: 2
    answer: "100"
    hint: "convert decimal to percentage"
solution: |
  weights = [0.50, 0.30, 0.20]
  returns = [0.10, 0.04, 0.02]

  portfolio_ret = sum(w * r for w, r in zip(weights, returns))
  print(f"Portfolio return: {portfolio_ret * 100:.1f}%")
hints:
  - "sum() can take a generator expression to compute the dot product."
  - "zip() pairs corresponding elements from weights and returns."

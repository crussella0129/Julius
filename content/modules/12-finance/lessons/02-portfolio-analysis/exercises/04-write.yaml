id: "02-portfolio-analysis-write-01"
prompt: "Write a function called max_drawdown that takes a list of portfolio values and returns the maximum drawdown as a decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%). Test it with the values [10000, 11000, 10500, 9500, 10200, 10800] and print the result as a percentage."
starter_code: "# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains the drawdown percentage"
    check: "'13' in output or '13.6' in output or '14' in output"
  - description: "Output mentions drawdown or percentage"
    check: "'drawdown' in output.lower() or '%' in output"
  - description: "Output has at least 1 line"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 1"
hints:
  - "Track the running peak value as you iterate through the list."
  - "At each point, drawdown = (peak - current) / peak."
  - "Keep track of the maximum drawdown seen so far."

prompt: "Build a mini quant project: (1) Create a list of 10 prices starting at 100, changing by a fixed pattern [+5, -3, +8, -2, +6, -4, +7, -1, +3]. (2) Compute a 3-period SMA. (3) Generate buy/sell signals: buy (print 'BUY') when price crosses above SMA, sell (print 'SELL') when price crosses below SMA. (4) Print a summary with the starting price, ending price, and total number of signals generated."
starter_code: "# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains BUY"
    check: "'buy' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output contains SELL"
    check: "'sell' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output shows starting price 100"
    check: "'100' in output"
  - description: "Output has at least 4 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 4"
hints:
  - "Build prices by applying each change: prices[i] = prices[i-1] + changes[i-1]."
  - "SMA(3) starts at index 2. Compare price vs SMA for crossover signals."
  - "A crossover occurs when the relationship between price and SMA changes from one day to the next."

prompt: "Write a program that creates a list of OHLCV dictionaries for 5 trading days (with keys 'date', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'). For each day, print whether it was an UP day (close > open) or DOWN day (close < open). Then print the day with the highest volume."
starter_code: "# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains UP or DOWN for each day"
    check: "output.lower().count('up') + output.lower().count('down') >= 5"
  - description: "Output mentions highest volume"
    check: "'volume' in output.lower() or 'highest' in output.lower() or 'max' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output has at least 6 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 6"
hints:
  - "Compare close to open for each candle to determine UP or DOWN."
  - "Use max() with a key function to find the day with the highest volume."
  - "Each dictionary should have: date, open, high, low, close, volume."

prompt: "Write a program that uses the sched module to schedule 3 events: print 'first' at delay 0, 'second' at delay 0 with lower priority, and 'third' at delay 0 with the lowest priority. Run the scheduler so all three print in order."
starter_code: |
  import sched
  import time

  s = sched.scheduler(time.time, time.sleep)
  # Your code here
tests:
  - description: "Output has exactly 3 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) == 3"
  - description: "First line is 'first'"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[0] == 'first'"
  - description: "Second line is 'second'"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[1] == 'second'"
  - description: "Third line is 'third'"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[2] == 'third'"
hints:
  - "Use s.enter(delay, priority, function, args)."
  - "Lower priority numbers run first. Use priorities 1, 2, 3."
  - "s.enter(0, 1, print, ('first',)); s.enter(0, 2, print, ('second',)); s.enter(0, 3, print, ('third',)); s.run()"

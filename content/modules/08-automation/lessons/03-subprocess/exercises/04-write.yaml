starter_code: |
  import subprocess

  # Your code here
tests:
  - description: "Output has exactly 2 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) == 2"
  - description: "First line is '50'"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[0] == '50'"
  - description: "Second line is 'success'"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[1] == 'success'"
hints:
  - "Use subprocess.run() with capture_output=True and text=True."
  - "Print result.stdout.strip() for the output value."
  - "Check result.returncode == 0 to determine success."

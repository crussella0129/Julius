prompt: "Write a function called compute_stats that uses NumPy (as a stand-in for CuPy's identical API) to compute the mean, standard deviation, min, and max of an array. Also normalize the array (subtract mean, divide by std). Test with the array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and print all statistics plus the first 3 normalized values."
starter_code: "import numpy as np\n\n# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains mean value (30.0)"
    check: "'30' in output"
  - description: "Output contains standard deviation"
    check: "'std' in output.lower() or '14.14' in output or '14.1' in output or 'deviation' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output shows normalized values"
    check: "'-1.41' in output or '-1.4' in output or 'normal' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output has at least 4 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 4"
hints:
  - "Use np.mean(), np.std(), np.min(), np.max() for statistics."
  - "Normalize: (array - mean) / std."
  - "These same functions work identically with CuPy on GPU."

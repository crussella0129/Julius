prompt: "Arrange these lines to write an array-library-agnostic function (the xp pattern) that works with both NumPy and CuPy."
blocks:
  - "import numpy as np"
  - "def compute_stats(xp, data):"
  - "    mean = xp.mean(data)"
  - "    std = xp.std(data)"

hints:
  - "The xp parameter can be numpy or cupy -- both have the same API."
  - "Normalize data by subtracting mean and dividing by std deviation."
  - "Call the function with np as the array library."

prompt: "Write a function called mandelbrot_grid that takes width, height, and max_iter parameters. It should compute the Mandelbrot set for x in [-2, 1] and y in [-1.5, 1.5]. For each grid point, iterate z = z*z + c until abs(z) > 2 or max_iter is reached. Print a simple ASCII visualization where points inside the set print '*' and escaped points print ' '. Use width=60, height=20, max_iter=50."
starter_code: "# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains asterisks (inside the set)"
    check: "'*' in output"
  - description: "Output has approximately 20 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 15"
  - description: "Output lines contain spaces (escaped points)"
    check: "' ' in output"
hints:
  - "Map grid coordinates to complex plane: c = complex(x, y)."
  - "For each point, iterate z = z*z + c. If abs(z) > 2, it escaped."
  - "Build each row as a string of '*' or ' ', then print it."

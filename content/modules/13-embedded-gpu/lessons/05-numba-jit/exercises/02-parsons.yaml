prompt: "Arrange these lines to show the Numba JIT compilation workflow: define a function with the decorator, call it once to trigger compilation, then benchmark the compiled version."
blocks:
  - "import time"
  - "# from numba import jit"
  - "# @jit(nopython=True)"
  - "def sum_squares(n):"
  - "    total = 0"
  - "    for i in range(n):"

hints:
  - "Import time first, then define the function with the @jit decorator."
  - "The warm-up call with a small input triggers compilation."
  - "Benchmark the subsequent call to measure compiled performance."

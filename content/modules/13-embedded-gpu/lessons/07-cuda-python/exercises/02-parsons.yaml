prompt: "Arrange these lines to simulate a grid-stride loop where 3 threads process 9 data elements (each thread handles multiple elements)."
blocks:
  - "data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"
  - "num_threads = 3"

hints:
  - "Each thread starts at its thread ID and steps by the total number of threads."
  - "Thread 0 processes indices 0, 3, 6. Thread 1 processes 1, 4, 7. Thread 2 processes 2, 5, 8."
  - "The stride (step) equals num_threads, not 1."

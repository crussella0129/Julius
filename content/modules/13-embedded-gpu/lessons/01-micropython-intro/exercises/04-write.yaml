prompt: "Write a MemoryTracker class for an embedded system. It should take total_kb in __init__ (convert to bytes). Add an allocate(name, size_bytes) method that tracks named allocations in a dictionary. Add a status() method that prints each allocation, total used, total available, and usage percentage. Test by allocating 'program' (50000 bytes), 'buffer' (100000 bytes), and 'stack' (20000 bytes) on a 264KB system."
starter_code: "# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains allocation names"
    check: "'program' in output.lower() and 'buffer' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output shows usage percentage"
    check: "'%' in output"
  - description: "Output shows total or available bytes"
    check: "'170000' in output or '100' in output or 'available' in output.lower() or 'total' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output has at least 4 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 4"
hints:
  - "Store allocations in a dictionary: self.allocations = {}."
  - "Total bytes = total_kb * 1024."
  - "Available = total - sum of all allocation sizes."

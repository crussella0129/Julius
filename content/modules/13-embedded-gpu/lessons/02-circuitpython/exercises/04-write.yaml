prompt: "Write a SensorStation class that collects temperature readings. It should have: __init__(name) to set the station name and initialize an empty list, add_reading(temp) to add a temperature, and report() that prints the station name, number of readings, min temp, max temp, and average temp. Test it by adding 5 readings: 22.5, 23.1, 21.8, 24.0, 22.3."
starter_code: "# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains min temperature (21.8)"
    check: "'21.8' in output"
  - description: "Output contains max temperature (24.0)"
    check: "'24.0' in output or '24' in output"
  - description: "Output contains number of readings (5)"
    check: "'5' in output"
  - description: "Output has at least 3 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 3"
hints:
  - "Store readings in a list, use min(), max(), and sum()/len() for the report."
  - "Round the average to one decimal place."
  - "Print station name, count, min, max, and average."

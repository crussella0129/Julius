prompt: "Write two functions that compute the sum of squares from 0 to N-1: one using a Python for-loop and one using NumPy vectorization. Compare them for N=1000000. Print the result from each (they should match) and the time each takes. Use time.time() for timing."
starter_code: "import numpy as np\nimport time\n\n# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Both methods produce the same result"
    check: "output.count('333332') >= 2 or output.count('33333') >= 2"
  - description: "Output shows timing for both methods"
    check: "output.lower().count('s') >= 2 or output.count('.') >= 4"
  - description: "Output mentions speedup or both loop and numpy"
    check: "'loop' in output.lower() or 'numpy' in output.lower() or 'speed' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output has at least 2 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 2"
hints:
  - "Loop version: sum i*i for i in range(n)."
  - "NumPy version: arr = np.arange(n); np.sum(arr * arr)."
  - "Wrap each in time.time() calls to measure duration."

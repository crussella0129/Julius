prompt: "Arrange these lines to create a function that scans a single port and returns whether it is open, using a timeout to avoid hanging."
blocks:
  - "import socket"
  - "def scan_port(host, port, timeout=1):"
  - "    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)"
  - "    sock.settimeout(timeout)"
  - "    try:"
  - "        result = sock.connect_ex((host, port))"

solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
hints:
  - "Start with the import, then define the function."
  - "connect_ex() returns 0 when the connection succeeds (port is open)."
  - "The finally block ensures the socket is always closed."

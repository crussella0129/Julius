prompt: "Write a function called classify_threats that takes a list of threat dictionaries (each with 'name' and 'targets' keys, where 'targets' is a list of CIA properties) and returns a dictionary grouping threat names by CIA property. Then call it with at least 3 threats and print each CIA property and its threats."
starter_code: "# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains 'confidentiality'"
    check: "'confidentiality' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output contains 'integrity'"
    check: "'integrity' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output contains 'availability'"
    check: "'availability' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output has at least 3 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 3"
hints:
  - "Create a dictionary with keys 'confidentiality', 'integrity', 'availability', each mapping to an empty list."
  - "Loop through each threat, then loop through its targets to append the threat name to the right list."
  - "Print each key-value pair from the resulting dictionary."

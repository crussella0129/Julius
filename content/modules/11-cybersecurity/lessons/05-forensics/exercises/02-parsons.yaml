prompt: "Arrange these lines to create a function that reads a file in binary chunks and computes its SHA-256 hash for evidence integrity verification."
blocks:
  - "import hashlib"
  - "def hash_file(filepath):"
  - "    h = hashlib.sha256()"
  - "    with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:"

hints:
  - "Import hashlib first, then define the function."
  - "Open the file in binary mode ('rb'), not text mode."
  - "Read in chunks with a while loop; break when chunk is empty."

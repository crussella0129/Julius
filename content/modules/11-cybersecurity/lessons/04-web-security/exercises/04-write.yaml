prompt: "Write a function called sanitize_input that takes a string and returns an HTML-escaped version using Python's html module. Test it with three inputs: a normal string, a string with <script> tags, and a string with quote characters. Print each original and sanitized version."
starter_code: "import html\n\n# Write your code here\n"
tests:
  - description: "Output contains '&lt;' (escaped less-than)"
    check: "'&lt;' in output"
  - description: "Output contains '&gt;' (escaped greater-than)"
    check: "'&gt;' in output"
  - description: "Output does not contain raw '<script>'"
    check: "'<script>' not in output"
  - description: "Output has at least 6 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) >= 6"
hints:
  - "Use html.escape() to convert special characters to HTML entities."
  - "Characters like < become &lt; and > becomes &gt;."
  - "Print both the original and sanitized version for each test input."

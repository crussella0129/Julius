prompt: "Arrange these lines to implement 2D max pooling with a 2x2 window on a 4x4 grid."
blocks:
  - "grid = [[1,3,2,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,2,1,3], [4,8,6,5]]"
  - "pool_size = 2"
  - "result = []"

  - "    row = []"
  - "    for j in range(0, len(grid[0]), pool_size):"
  - "        patch = [grid[i+di][j+dj] for di in range(pool_size) for dj in range(pool_size)]"
  - "        row.append(max(patch))"
  - "    result.append(row)"

solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
hints:
  - "Step through the grid with stride equal to pool_size."
  - "Extract a 2x2 patch at each position."
  - "Max pooling takes the maximum value from each patch."

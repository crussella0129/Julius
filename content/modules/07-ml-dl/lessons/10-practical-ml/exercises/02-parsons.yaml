prompt: "Arrange these lines to build a simple ML pipeline: scale features, train a model, save it, then load and predict."
blocks:
  - "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler"
  - "import pickle"
  - "scaler = StandardScaler()"
  - "X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)"

solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
hints:
  - "Fit the scaler on training data only, then transform both train and test."
  - "Save both the scaler and model together."
  - "When loading, transform test data with the loaded scaler before predicting."

prompt: "Write a function called `train_test_split` that takes a list of data items and a float `test_ratio` (e.g., 0.2). It should return two lists: (train, test). The split index is int(len(data) * (1 - test_ratio)). Also write a function `accuracy` that takes two lists (predictions, actual) and returns the fraction correct. Demo: split the list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] with test_ratio=0.3, then compute accuracy of [1,0,1] vs [1,1,1]. Print both results."

tests:
  - description: "Train set has 7 items"
    check: "'7' in output"
  - description: "Test set has 3 items"
    check: "'3' in output or '[8, 9, 10]' in output"
  - description: "Accuracy is approximately 0.67"
    check: "'0.67' in output or '0.6' in output or '2' in output"
hints:
  - "Use int(len(data) * (1 - test_ratio)) for the split index."
  - "Slice data[:split] for train, data[split:] for test."
  - "Accuracy: sum(p == a for p, a in zip(pred, actual)) / len(pred)."

prompt: "Write a class called `LinearModel` that simulates a single linear layer: __init__(n_features) sets weights to zeros and bias to 0; forward(x) returns dot product + bias; train(data, epochs, lr) trains on a list of (inputs, target) pairs using MSE gradient descent. After training on [([1], 2), ([2], 4), ([3], 6), ([4], 8)] for 100 epochs with lr=0.01, print the weight and bias, and predict for x=[5]."

  # Write your class here
tests:
  - description: "Weight is approximately 2.0"
    check: "'1.9' in output or '2.0' in output or '2.' in output"
  - description: "Prediction for 5 is approximately 10"
    check: "'9.' in output or '10' in output"
hints:
  - "MSE gradient for weight: 2 * error * x, for bias: 2 * error."
  - "Update: w -= lr * gradient, b -= lr * gradient."
  - "The data follows y = 2x, so the model should learn weight~2, bias~0."

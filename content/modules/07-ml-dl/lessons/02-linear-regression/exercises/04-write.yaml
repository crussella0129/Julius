prompt: "Write a class called `SimpleLinearRegression` with methods `fit(x, y)` (computes and stores slope and intercept), `predict(x_value)` (returns slope * x + intercept), and `r_squared(x, y)` (returns R-squared: 1 - SS_res/SS_tot). Train it on x=[1,2,3,4,5], y=[2,4,5,4,5] and print the slope, intercept, prediction for x=6, and R-squared."

  # Write your class here
tests:
  - description: "Output contains slope value"
    check: "'0.' in output or 'slope' in output.lower()"
  - description: "Output contains prediction for x=6"
    check: "'6' in output"
  - description: "R-squared is between 0 and 1"
    check: "'0.' in output"
hints:
  - "slope = sum((xi-xmean)*(yi-ymean)) / sum((xi-xmean)^2)."
  - "intercept = y_mean - slope * x_mean."
  - "R-squared = 1 - sum((yi-pred_i)^2) / sum((yi-y_mean)^2)."

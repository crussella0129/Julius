prompt: "Fill in the blanks to compute the slope and intercept of a simple linear regression."
template: |
  x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  y = [2, 4, 5, 4]

  n = len(x)
  x_mean = ____(x) / n
  y_mean = sum(y) / n

  num = sum((xi - x_mean) * (yi - y_mean) for xi, yi in ____(x, y))
  den = sum((xi - x_mean) ** ____ for xi in x)

  slope = num / den
  intercept = y_mean - ____ * x_mean
  print(f\"y = {slope:.1f}x + {intercept:.1f}\")
blanks:
  - position: 0
    answer: "sum"
    hint: "function to add all values"
  - position: 1
    answer: "zip"
    hint: "function to pair x and y values"
  - position: 2
    answer: "2"
    hint: "exponent for squaring"
  - position: 3
    answer: "slope"
    hint: "the slope variable computed above"

  x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  y = [2, 4, 5, 4]

  n = len(x)
  x_mean = sum(x) / n
  y_mean = sum(y) / n

  num = sum((xi - x_mean) * (yi - y_mean) for xi, yi in zip(x, y))
  den = sum((xi - x_mean) ** 2 for xi in x)

  slope = num / den
  intercept = y_mean - slope * x_mean
  print(f"y = {slope:.1f}x + {intercept:.1f}")
hints:
  - "The slope formula divides the covariance by the variance of x."
  - "intercept = y_mean - slope * x_mean positions the line through the means."

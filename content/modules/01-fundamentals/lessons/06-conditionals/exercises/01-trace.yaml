    explanation: "75 >= 90 is False, so we skip to the next elif."

    explanation: "75 >= 70 is True, so grade is assigned 'C'. Remaining branches are skipped."

hints:
  - "Python checks elif conditions from top to bottom and runs only the first match."
  - "Once a branch matches, all remaining elif/else branches are skipped."

prompt: "Trace through this code and predict what the final output will be."
code: |
  x = 5
  y = 10
  x = y
  y = 20
  print(x)
  print(y)
steps:
  - line: 1
    variables: { "x": "5" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "x is assigned the value 5."
  - line: 2
    variables: { "x": "5", "y": "10" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "y is assigned the value 10."
  - line: 3
    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "10" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "x is reassigned to the current value of y, which is 10."
  - line: 4
    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "20" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "y is reassigned to 20. This does NOT change x — x still holds 10."
  - line: 5
    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "20" }
    output: "10"
    explanation: "Prints the value of x, which is 10."
  - line: 6
    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "20" }
    output: "20"
    explanation: "Prints the value of y, which is 20."
expected_output: |
  10
  20
hints:
  - "When you assign x = y, x gets the current value of y at that moment."
  - "Changing y later does NOT retroactively change x."

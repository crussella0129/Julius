steps:
  - line: 1
    variables: { "total": "0" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "total is initialized to 0."
  - line: 2
    variables: { "total": "0", "i": "1" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "First iteration: i = 1 (range(1,5) produces 1, 2, 3, 4)."
  - line: 3
    variables: { "total": "1", "i": "1" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "total += 1 → total is now 1."
  - line: 2
    variables: { "total": "1", "i": "2" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "Second iteration: i = 2."
  - line: 3
    variables: { "total": "3", "i": "2" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "total += 2 → total is now 3."
  - line: 2
    variables: { "total": "3", "i": "3" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "Third iteration: i = 3."
  - line: 3

    output: ""
    explanation: "total += 3 → total is now 6."

    explanation: "Fourth iteration: i = 4."
  - line: 3
    variables: { "total": "10", "i": "4" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "total += 4 → total is now 10."
  - line: 4
    variables: { "total": "10", "i": "4" }
    output: "10"
    explanation: "Loop is done. Prints total = 10 (1+2+3+4)."
expected_output: |
  10
hints:
  - "range(1, 5) produces the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 — NOT including 5."
  - "+= adds the right side to the current value of total."

code: |
  x = 10
  y = 3
  a = x // y
  b = x % y
  c = a + b
  print(c)
steps:
  - line: 1
    variables: { "x": "10" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "x is assigned the value 10."
  - line: 2
    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "3" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "y is assigned the value 3."
  - line: 3
    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "3", "a": "3" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "10 // 3 is floor division, which gives 3 (rounds down)."
  - line: 4
    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "3", "a": "3", "b": "1" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "10 % 3 is the remainder of 10 divided by 3, which is 1."
  - line: 5
    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "3", "a": "3", "b": "1", "c": "4" }
    output: ""
    explanation: "a + b = 3 + 1 = 4."

    variables: { "x": "10", "y": "3", "a": "3", "b": "1", "c": "4" }
    output: "4"
    explanation: "Prints the value of c, which is 4."

  # Write your function here
tests:
  - description: "Output shows username error (too short)"
    check: "'username' in output.lower() or 'at least 3' in output"
  - description: "Output shows email error (no @)"
    check: "'email' in output.lower() or '@' in output"
  - description: "No password error (8 chars is valid)"
    check: "'password' not in output.lower().split('email')[0] if 'email' in output.lower() else True"
hints:
  - "Create an empty list and append errors as you find them."
  - "Use len() to check string lengths."
  - "Use 'in' to check if '@' is in the email."

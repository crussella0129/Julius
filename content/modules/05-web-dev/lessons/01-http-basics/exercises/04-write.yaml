prompt: "Write a function called `parse_url` that takes a URL string and returns a dictionary with keys 'scheme', 'host', and 'path'. For example, parse_url('https://example.com/about') should return {'scheme': 'https', 'host': 'example.com', 'path': '/about'}. Use the urllib.parse module. Print the result of calling it with 'https://example.com/about'."
starter_code: |
  from urllib.parse import urlparse

  # Write your function here
tests:
  - description: "Output contains 'https' as scheme"
    check: "'https' in output"
  - description: "Output contains 'example.com' as host"
    check: "'example.com' in output"
  - description: "Output contains '/about' as path"
    check: "'/about' in output"
hints:
  - "urlparse() returns an object with attributes like .scheme, .netloc, and .path."
  - "Build a dictionary from the parsed result's attributes."
  - "Remember to print the dictionary at the end."

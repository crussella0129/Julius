prompt: "Arrange these lines to create a function that converts a BGR image to grayscale using the luminosity formula (0.114*B + 0.587*G + 0.299*R)."
blocks:
  - "import numpy as np"
  - "def bgr_to_gray(img):"
  - "    b = img[:, :, 0].astype(float)"
  - "    g = img[:, :, 1].astype(float)"
  - "    r = img[:, :, 2].astype(float)"
  - "    gray = (0.114 * b + 0.587 * g + 0.299 * r)"
  - "    return gray.astype(np.uint8)"
distractors:
  - "    gray = (0.333 * b + 0.333 * g + 0.333 * r)"
  - "    r = img[:, :, 0].astype(float)"
solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
hints:
  - "In BGR format, channel 0 is Blue, channel 1 is Green, channel 2 is Red."
  - "The luminosity weights are not equal -- green contributes most to perceived brightness."

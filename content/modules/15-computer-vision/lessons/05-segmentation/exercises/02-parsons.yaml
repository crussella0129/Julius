prompt: "Arrange these lines to create a function that finds boundary pixels in a binary mask (pixels that are foreground but have at least one background or out-of-bounds neighbor)."
blocks:
  - "def find_boundary(mask):"
  - "    h, w = mask.shape"
  - "    boundary = []"

hints:
  - "Skip background pixels (value 0) immediately."
  - "A foreground pixel is on the boundary if ANY neighbor is background or out of bounds."

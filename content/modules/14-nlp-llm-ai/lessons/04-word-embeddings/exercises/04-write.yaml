prompt: "Write a function called cosine_similarity that takes two lists of numbers (vectors) and returns their cosine similarity. Then write find_most_similar that takes a target word, a dictionary of word embeddings, and returns the most similar word (excluding the target itself). Test it with the embeddings: cat=[0.7,0.2,-0.1], dog=[0.6,0.3,-0.1], car=[-0.3,0.1,0.8], truck=[-0.2,0.2,0.7]. Print the most similar word to 'cat'."

  # Write cosine_similarity and find_most_similar here

  embeddings = {
      "cat": [0.7, 0.2, -0.1],
      "dog": [0.6, 0.3, -0.1],
      "car": [-0.3, 0.1, 0.8],
      "truck": [-0.2, 0.2, 0.7],
  }
  print(find_most_similar("cat", embeddings))
tests:
  - description: "Most similar to cat is dog"
    check: "'dog' in output"
  - description: "Output is a single word"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) == 1"
hints:
  - "Cosine similarity = dot product / (magnitude_a * magnitude_b)."
  - "Iterate over all words in embeddings, skip the target, track the highest similarity."
  - "math.sqrt(sum(x*x for x in v)) gives the magnitude."

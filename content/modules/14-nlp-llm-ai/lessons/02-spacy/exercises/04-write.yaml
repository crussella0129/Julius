prompt: "Write a function called pos_summary that takes a list of (word, pos_tag) tuples and returns a dictionary mapping each POS tag to the count of words with that tag. Print the result for the input [('The', 'DET'), ('cat', 'NOUN'), ('sat', 'VERB'), ('on', 'ADP'), ('the', 'DET'), ('mat', 'NOUN')]."
starter_code: |
  # Write your pos_summary function here

  words = [('The', 'DET'), ('cat', 'NOUN'), ('sat', 'VERB'), ('on', 'ADP'), ('the', 'DET'), ('mat', 'NOUN')]
  print(pos_summary(words))
tests:
  - description: "Output contains DET with count 2"
    check: "'DET' in output and '2' in output"
  - description: "Output contains NOUN with count 2"
    check: "'NOUN' in output and '2' in output"
  - description: "Output contains VERB with count 1"
    check: "'VERB' in output"
  - description: "Output is a dictionary"
    check: "output.strip().startswith('{')"
hints:
  - "Iterate over the tuples and unpack each into word and tag."
  - "Use dict.get(key, 0) + 1 to count occurrences."
  - "You only need the POS tag for counting, not the word text."

prompt: "Write a function called build_vocab that takes a list of document strings and returns a sorted list of unique words (lowercased). Then write a function doc_to_vector that takes a document string and the vocabulary list, and returns a list of word counts. Print the vocabulary and the vector for 'the cat sat on the mat' given the corpus ['the cat sat', 'the dog ran', 'a cat and a dog']."
starter_code: |
  from collections import Counter

  # Write build_vocab and doc_to_vector here

  corpus = ["the cat sat", "the dog ran", "a cat and a dog"]
  vocab = build_vocab(corpus)
  print(vocab)
  print(doc_to_vector("the cat sat on the mat", vocab))
tests:
  - description: "Vocabulary is a sorted list"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[0].startswith('[')"
  - description: "Vocabulary contains 'cat'"
    check: "'cat' in output.strip().splitlines()[0]"
  - description: "Vector is a list of integers"
    check: "output.strip().splitlines()[1].startswith('[')"
  - description: "Vector has same length as vocabulary"
    check: "len(eval(output.strip().splitlines()[0])) == len(eval(output.strip().splitlines()[1]))"
hints:
  - "Use set() to collect unique words, then sorted() to order them."
  - "Use Counter on the split words, then look up each vocab word."
  - "Words not in the document should have a count of 0."

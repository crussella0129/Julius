prompt: "Arrange these lines to build an n-gram function that takes a list of tokens and a number n, and returns all contiguous n-grams as tuples."
blocks:
  - "def ngrams(tokens, n):"
  - "    result = []"
  - "    for i in range(len(tokens) - n + 1):"
  - "        gram = tuple(tokens[i:i+n])"
  - "        result.append(gram)"
  - "    return result"
distractors:
  - "    for i in range(len(tokens)):"
  - "        gram = tokens[i:i+n]"
solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
hints:
  - "The loop range must stop early enough so the slice doesn't go past the end."
  - "N-grams are typically returned as tuples, not lists."
concept_tags:
  - tokenization

prompt: "Write a simulation of a bouncing ball. Start at position y=0 with vel_y=0 and gravity=3. The ground is at y=30. When the ball hits the ground, it bounces with 50% energy loss (multiply vel_y by -0.5). Simulate 10 frames and print 'Frame N: y=Y vel_y=V' for each. Use integer or rounded values."
starter_code: |
  # Simulate bouncing ball with energy loss
tests:
  - description: "Output has 10 lines"
    check: "len(output.strip().splitlines()) == 10"
  - description: "First frame shows movement"
    check: "'Frame 0' in output"
  - description: "Ball hits ground and bounces (vel_y becomes negative)"
    check: "any('vel_y=-' in line for line in output.strip().splitlines())"
hints:
  - "Each frame: vel_y += gravity, y += vel_y, then check ground."
  - "On ground hit: y = 30, vel_y = -vel_y * 0.5."
  - "Use round() for clean output."

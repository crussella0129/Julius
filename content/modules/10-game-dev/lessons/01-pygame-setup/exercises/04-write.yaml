prompt: "Write a program that simulates a simple game loop counter. Create a variable `frame` starting at 0, and loop 60 times (simulating 1 second at 60 FPS). Each iteration, increment frame by 1. After the loop, print the total frames, the simulated FPS (60), and the simulated time elapsed ('1.0 seconds')."

  # Simulate a game loop
tests:
  - description: "Output shows 60 frames"
    check: "'60' in output"
  - description: "Output mentions FPS"
    check: "'60' in output"
  - description: "Output shows time elapsed"
    check: "'1.0' in output or '1 second' in output.lower()"
hints:
  - "Use a for loop: for _ in range(60): frame += 1"
  - "FPS is 60, time = frames / FPS = 60 / 60 = 1.0"
  - "print(f'Frames: {frame}'); print(f'FPS: 60'); print(f'Time: {frame / 60} seconds')"

prompt: "Write a simplified text-based dodge game simulation. Create a Player class (x position, lives=3) and a game loop that runs for 20 frames. Each frame: move the player to a random x position (0-9), spawn an obstacle at a random x (0-9), and if they match, the player loses a life. Use random.seed(42). Print 'Frame N: player=X obstacle=O HIT!' or 'Frame N: player=X obstacle=O safe' for each frame. At the end print 'Survived! Score: 20' or 'Game Over! Score: N'."
starter_code: |
  import random
  random.seed(42)

  # Your code here
tests:
  - description: "Output contains Frame 0"
    check: "'Frame 0' in output"
  - description: "Output shows hit or safe for each frame"
    check: "'HIT' in output or 'safe' in output"
  - description: "Output ends with Score line"
    check: "'Score:' in output.strip().splitlines()[-1]"
hints:
  - "Use random.randint(0, 9) for both player and obstacle positions."
  - "If player_x == obstacle_x, it's a HIT and lives -= 1."
  - "Break the loop if lives reach 0."

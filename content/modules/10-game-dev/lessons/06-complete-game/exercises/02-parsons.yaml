prompt: "Arrange these lines to create a simple game loop that spawns falling objects, checks collisions with a player, tracks score, and ends when lives reach zero."
blocks:
  - "player_x = 50"
  - "lives = 3"
  - "score = 0"
  - "obstacles = []"
  - "while lives > 0:"
  - "    obstacles.append(100)"
  - "    obstacles = [y + 10 for y in obstacles]"
  - "    obstacles = [y for y in obstacles if y < 200]"
  - "    score += 1"
  - "    if any(y > 150 for y in obstacles):"
  - "        lives -= 1"
  - "print(f'Final score: {score}')"
distractors:
  - "while score > 0:"
  - "    if obstacles > 150:"
solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
hints:
  - "Initialize player, lives, score, and obstacle list first."
  - "The game loop runs while lives > 0."
  - "Each iteration: spawn, move, remove off-screen, score, check collisions."

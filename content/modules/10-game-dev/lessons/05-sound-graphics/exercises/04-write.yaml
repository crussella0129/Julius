prompt: "Write a ParticleSystem class. It should have: an `emit(x, y, count)` method that creates `count` particles at position (x, y), each with random vel_x between -2 and 2 and vel_y between -3 and 0, a lifetime of 5, and age 0. An `update()` method that moves each particle by its velocity, increments age, and removes dead particles. A `count_alive()` method. Test: emit 10 particles at (0,0), print alive count, update 6 times, print alive count again."
starter_code: |
  import random
  random.seed(42)

  # Define ParticleSystem class

  # Test
tests:
  - description: "First count is 10"
    check: "'10' in output.strip().splitlines()[0]"
  - description: "Second count is 0 (all particles expired after 6 updates)"
    check: "'0' in output.strip().splitlines()[1]"
hints:
  - "Store particles as a list of dicts with keys: x, y, vel_x, vel_y, lifetime, age."
  - "In update: increment age, move by velocity, filter out particles where age >= lifetime."
  - "count_alive returns len(self.particles)."

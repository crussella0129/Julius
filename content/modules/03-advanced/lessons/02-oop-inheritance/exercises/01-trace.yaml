    output: "2024 Toyota (4-door)"
    explanation: "c.info() calls Car's info, which calls super().info() to get '2024 Toyota', then appends '(4-door)'."

    output: "True"
    explanation: "c is an instance of Car, and Car inherits from Vehicle, so isinstance(c, Vehicle) is True."
expected_output: |
  2024 Toyota (4-door)
  True
hints:
  - "super().__init__() calls the parent class's __init__ method."
  - "super().info() inside Car.info() calls Vehicle.info() to get the base string."
  - "isinstance() returns True for parent classes too, not just the exact class."

prompt: "Arrange these lines to count the frequency of each word in a sentence and print the result."
blocks:
  - "sentence = 'the cat sat on the mat'"
  - "words = sentence.split()"
  - "freq = {}"

distractors:
  - "    freq[word] += 1"
  - "    freq[word] = freq[word] + 1"
hints:
  - "Use .get(word, 0) to safely handle keys not yet in the dictionary."

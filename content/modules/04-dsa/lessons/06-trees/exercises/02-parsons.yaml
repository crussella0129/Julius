prompt: "Arrange these lines to implement a recursive function that calculates the height of a binary tree."
blocks:
  - "def height(node):"
  - "    if node is None:"
  - "        return -1"
  - "    left_h = height(node.left)"
  - "    right_h = height(node.right)"
  - "    return 1 + max(left_h, right_h)"
solution_order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
distractors:
  - "        return 0"
  - "    return left_h + right_h"
hints:
  - "Base case: an empty tree (None) has height -1 so a single node has height 0."
  - "Height is 1 plus the maximum of the left and right subtree heights."

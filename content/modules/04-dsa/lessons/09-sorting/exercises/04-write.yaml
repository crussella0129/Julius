prompt: "Write a complete merge_sort(arr) function that recursively splits the array and merges sorted halves. Print the result of merge_sort([38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10])."
starter_code: |
  # Write merge_sort(arr) with a merge helper, then print the sorted result
tests:
  - description: "Output is [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]"
    check: "output.strip() == '[3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]'"
  - description: "Result is sorted"
    check: "'3' in output and '82' in output"
hints:
  - "Base case: if len(arr) <= 1, return arr."
  - "Split at mid = len(arr) // 2, recursively sort both halves, then merge."
concept_tags:
  - merge-sort

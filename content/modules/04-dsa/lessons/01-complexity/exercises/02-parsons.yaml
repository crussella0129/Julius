prompt: "Arrange these lines to implement a binary search that returns the index of a target in a sorted list, or -1 if not found. Binary search is O(log n)."
blocks:
  - "def binary_search(nums, target):"
  - "    low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1"
  - "    while low <= high:"
  - "        mid = (low + high) // 2"
  - "        if nums[mid] == target:"
  - "            return mid"
  - "        elif nums[mid] < target:"

distractors:
  - "        low = mid"
  - "    while low < high:"
hints:
  - "Binary search needs low and high pointers that narrow toward the target."
  - "The loop continues while low <= high (with equals), not just low < high."

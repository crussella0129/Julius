prompt: "Write a function called count_ops(n) that simulates an O(n^2) algorithm: use two nested loops from 0 to n-1 and count the total number of operations. Print the count at the end. For example, count_ops(3) should print 9."
starter_code: |
  # Write count_ops(n) that counts operations in nested loops
tests:
  - description: "count_ops(3) prints 9"
    check: "'9' in output.strip().splitlines()[-1]"
  - description: "count_ops(4) prints 16"
    check: |
      # Re-run with n=4
      lines = output.strip().splitlines()
      '16' in lines[-1] if len(lines) > 1 else False
  - description: "count_ops(1) prints 1"
    check: "'1' in output.strip().split('\\n')[0]"
hints:
  - "Use two nested for loops: for i in range(n) and for j in range(n)."
  - "Increment a counter inside the inner loop, then print it after both loops finish."

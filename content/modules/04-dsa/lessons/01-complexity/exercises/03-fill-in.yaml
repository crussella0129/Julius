prompt: "Fill in the blanks to complete the function that checks if a list has duplicates in O(n) time using a set."
template: |
  def has_duplicate(nums):
      ____ = set()
      for num in nums:
          if num in ____:
              return True
          ____.add(num)
      return False
blanks:
  - position: 0
    answer: "seen"
    hint: "name for the set that tracks values we have encountered"
  - position: 1
    answer: "seen"
    hint: "check if the current number is already in our set"
  - position: 2
    answer: "seen"
    hint: "add the current number to the tracking set"

  def has_duplicate(nums):
      seen = set()
      for num in nums:
          if num in seen:
              return True
          seen.add(num)
      return False
hints:
  - "A set provides O(1) average lookup, making the whole function O(n)."
  - "Without a set, you would need nested loops for O(n^2) time."

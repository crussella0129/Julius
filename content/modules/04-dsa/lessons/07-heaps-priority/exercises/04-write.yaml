prompt: "Write a function called heap_sort(nums) that takes a list of numbers, uses heapq to sort them, and returns the sorted list. Print the result of calling heap_sort([5, 3, 8, 1, 2, 7, 4, 6])."
starter_code: |
  import heapq
  # Write heap_sort(nums) and print the sorted result
tests:
  - description: "Output is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"
    check: "output.strip() == '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]'"
  - description: "Result is sorted"
    check: "'1' in output and '8' in output"
hints:
  - "Use heapq.heapify(copy) to convert to a heap, then heappop in a loop."
  - "Remember to work on a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original."

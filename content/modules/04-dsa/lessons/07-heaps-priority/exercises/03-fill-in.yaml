prompt: "Fill in the blanks to implement a max-heap using Python's heapq (which only supports min-heap). Push the values 3, 1, 4, then pop and print the largest."
template: |
  import heapq

  max_heap = []
  for val in [3, 1, 4]:
      heapq.heappush(max_heap, ____val)

  largest = ____heapq.heappop(max_heap)
  print(largest)
blanks:
  - position: 0
    answer: "-"
    hint: "negate to turn min-heap into max-heap"
  - position: 1
    answer: "-"
    hint: "negate again to get the original value back"
solution: |
  import heapq

  max_heap = []
  for val in [3, 1, 4]:
      heapq.heappush(max_heap, -val)

  largest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
  print(largest)
hints:
  - "Push -val so the largest original value becomes the smallest negative value."
  - "After popping, negate again to restore the original positive value."

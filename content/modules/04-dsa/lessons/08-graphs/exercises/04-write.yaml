prompt: "Write a function called count_components(graph) that counts the number of connected components in an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list (dict). Test it with: {1: [2], 2: [1], 3: [4], 4: [3], 5: []}. Print the count."
starter_code: |
  from collections import deque
  # Write count_components(graph) and test it
tests:
  - description: "Output is 3 (three components: {1,2}, {3,4}, {5})"
    check: "'3' in output.strip()"
  - description: "Output is a single number"
    check: "output.strip().isdigit()"
hints:
  - "Loop over all nodes. For each unvisited node, start a BFS/DFS to mark the entire component."
  - "Increment the component count each time you start a new BFS/DFS."

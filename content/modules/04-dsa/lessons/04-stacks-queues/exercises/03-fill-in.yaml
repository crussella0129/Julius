prompt: "Fill in the blanks to implement a stack that reverses a string. Push each character, then pop them all to build the reversed string."
template: |
  word = "hello"
  stack = []
  for char in word:
      stack.____(char)
  reversed_word = ""
  while ____:
      reversed_word += stack.____()

blanks:
  - position: 0
    answer: "append"
    hint: "the push operation for a Python list stack"
  - position: 1
    answer: "stack"
    hint: "loop while the stack is not empty"
  - position: 2
    answer: "pop"
    hint: "remove and return the top element"
solution: |
  word = "hello"
  stack = []
  for char in word:
      stack.append(char)
  reversed_word = ""
  while stack:
      reversed_word += stack.pop()
  print(reversed_word)
hints:
  - "append() pushes onto the stack, pop() removes from the top."
  - "Since a stack is LIFO, popping all characters reverses their order."

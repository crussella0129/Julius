  - id: "q01"
    module_target: "01-fundamentals"
    prompt: "What does this code print?"
    code: |
      x = 5
      y = x + 3
      x = 10
      print(y)
    choices:
      - { label: "A", text: "13" }
      - { label: "B", text: "8" }
      - { label: "C", text: "10" }
      - { label: "D", text: "Error" }
    correct: "B"
    explanation: "y was assigned x + 3 when x was 5, so y = 8. Changing x later doesn't affect y."

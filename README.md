###This is Julius

##An Open Source Python teaching tool so good that it could teach my Ball Python, Julius Squeezer, to become a python master. 
- It's funny because Julius isn't very smart OR cooperative.

##Julius is a teaching tool for learning python and various python derived languages like pytorch, embedded python, python CUDA, and other languages in the Python ecosystem. Mastering python itself first is the priority though, before moving on to those specialized modules. 
- The app uses *research backed methods* to teach syntax, pre-made projects, as well as "ideas of other things you can make" with the contents of each lesson, from the most basic to the most complex levels. The why behind everything is explained.
- It is designed in such a way that modules can be added by the community (via a fork) and if those modules are value-adding, can be easily merged back upstream (so very "modular" build for lack of a better description).
- We want the app to be primarily GUI Based but if there are terminal based lessons or if its required for the terminal, we can load a terminal *through* the GUI, thus having a pedagogical aide to the terminal always with you even when the work is terminal work.
- We want the app to work on Windows, Linux or MacOS
